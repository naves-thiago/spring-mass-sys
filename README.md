Spring Mass systems with restrictions moviment simulator

Description
-----------
This is a physics based 2D motion simulator for poligons and spings.  
Any number of vertexes can be connected with edges to each other.  
The edges are fixed size (defined by the initial vertexes positions) and have no mass.  
Vertexes can have initial velocity.  
Springs connect a vertex to a fixed point in the simulation plane.  
Springs also have no mass.  
Spring stiffness can be adjusted per string.
